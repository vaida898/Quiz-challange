# UX (User experience)

## Project Goals

user have fun and enjoy the play. 


### User Goals:

* Gameplay is not too complicated and self-explanatory 
* Interact with the website on Desktop, Tablet and Mobile

### User Stories:




### Site Owner Goals:
* Make sure that game is functional and reacts as expected
* Selector boxes and button respond as expected
* Colour scheme and background is not too much into a face and doesn't tire user
* User enjoys game and plays it not even once

# User Requirements and Expectations:

### Requirements:
* Gameplay is easy to understand and doesn't need to be explained
* Text is easily readible and understandable
* Background and provided images does not disturb and complicate Gameplay
* Game is not offensive and does not exclude any player 

### Expectations:

* You are able to choose difficulty level 
* You are able to choose how many questions you will be asked
* Buttons and selector boxes either correspods as expexted or gives predicted choices
* Able to see your score and see correct and incorrect answers after finishing

# Design Choices:
This website should be interactive and more fun so the best way to combine everythings was to create fun 
quiz game for a user. Games normally cheer people up and in this case colour scheme was picked to brighten
everything up.

### Fonts:
Website itself does not have a lot of design features so I decided to make a writting stand out and choise 
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Slackey&selection.family=Lato">Slackey</a> font for headings.

Another font I picked was to make selector boxes more playful and attractive was 
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Lemon&selection.family=Lato">Lemon</a> which is not too much 
in your eyes but also calls you for fun time.

### Colours:
* #000000 (Black)
* #3FCCF5 (Shocking pink)
* #F222D9 (Maya blue)
* #B7FFE0 (Light cyan)
* #FF837D (Vivid tangerine)
* #B8F5FA (Columbia blue)

### Styling:


### Images + Background:
Background image had been found on <a href="https://hdblackwallpaper.com">Hdblackwallpaper.com</a>. I wanted to have simple
and more abstract with bright colours background image because I wanted to focus on gameplay and functionality.

# Wireframes:
I have built wireframes for this project using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> mockups. I created basic wireframes for Mobile/Tablet/Desktop
on Balsamiq to show how structurally elements would appear on the page for different devices. Wireframes can be found by clicking this link in my repository:
