# Design Choices:
This website should be interactive and more fun so the best way to combine everythings was to create fun 
quiz game for a user. Games normally cheer people up and in this case colour scheme was picked to brighten
everything up.

### Fonts:
Website itself does not have a lot of design features so I decided to make a writting stand out and choise 
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Slackey&selection.family=Lato">Slackey</a> font for headings.

Another font I picked was to make selector boxes more playful and attractive was 
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Lemon&selection.family=Lato">Lemon</a> which is not too much 
in your eyes but also calls you for fun time.

### Icons:


### Colours:
* #ffffff (White)
* #000000 (Black)
* #3FCCF5
* #F222D9

### Styling:


### Images + Background:
Background image had been found on <a href="https://hdblackwallpaper.com">Hdblackwallpaper.com</a>. I wanted to have simple
and more abstract with bright colours background image because I wanted to focus on gameplay and functionality.
